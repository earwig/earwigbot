**EarwigBot: Wiki Toolset: Constants**

This module defines some useful constants:

- :py:const:`USER_AGENT`: our default User Agent when making API queries
- :py:const:`NS_*`:       default namespace IDs for easy lookup

Import directly with ``from earwigbot.wiki import constants`` or
``from earwigbot.wiki.constants import *``. These are also available from
:py:mod:`earwigbot.wiki` directly (e.g. ``earwigbot.wiki.USER_AGENT``).
