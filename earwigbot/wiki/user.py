    **EarwigBot: Wiki Toolset: User**

    Represents a user on a given :py:class:`~earwigbot.wiki.site.Site`. Has
    methods for getting a bunch of information about the user, such as
    editcount and user rights, methods for returning the user's userpage and
    talkpage, etc.

    *Attributes:*

    - :py:attr:`site`:         the user's corresponding Site object
    - :py:attr:`name`:         the user's username
    - :py:attr:`exists`:       ``True`` if the user exists, else ``False``
    - :py:attr:`userid`:       an integer ID representing the user
    - :py:attr:`blockinfo`:    information about any current blocks on the user
    - :py:attr:`groups`:       a list of the user's groups
    - :py:attr:`rights`:       a list of the user's rights
    - :py:attr:`editcount`:    the number of edits made by the user
    - :py:attr:`registration`: the time the user registered
    - :py:attr:`emailable`:    ``True`` if you can email the user, or ``False``
    - :py:attr:`gender`:       the user's gender ("male"/"female"/"unknown")
    - :py:attr:`is_ip`:        ``True`` if this is an IP address, or ``False``

    *Public methods:*

    - :py:meth:`reload`:       forcibly reloads the user's attributes
    - :py:meth:`get_userpage`: returns a Page object representing the user's
      userpage
    - :py:meth:`get_talkpage`: returns a Page object representing the user's
      talkpage
