    **EarwigBot: Base IRC Command**

    This package provides built-in IRC "commands" used by the bot's front-end
    component. Additional commands can be installed as plugins in the bot's
    working directory.

    This class (import with ``from earwigbot.commands import Command``), can be
    subclassed to create custom IRC commands.

    This docstring is reported to the user when they type ``"!help
    <command>"``.
