**EarwigBot: Wiki Toolset**

This is a collection of classes and functions to read from and write to
Wikipedia and other wiki sites. No connection whatsoever to `python-wikitools
<https://github.com/alexz-enwp/wikitools>`_ written by `Mr.Z-man
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mr.Z-man>`_, other than a similar purpose.
We share no code.

Import the toolset directly with ``from earwigbot import wiki``. If using the
built-in integration with the rest of the bot, :py:class:`~earwigbot.bot.Bot`
objects contain a :py:attr:`~earwigbot.bot.Bot.wiki` attribute, which is a
:py:class:`~earwigbot.wiki.sitesdb.SitesDB` object tied to the :file:`sites.db`
file located in the same directory as :file:`config.yml`. That object has the
principal methods :py:meth:`~earwigbot.wiki.sitesdb.SitesDB.get_site`,
:py:meth:`~earwigbot.wiki.sitesdb.SitesDB.add_site`, and
:py:meth:`~earwigbot.wiki.sitesdb.SitesDB.remove_site` that should handle all
of your :py:class:`~earwigbot.wiki.site.Site` (and thus,
:py:class:`~earwigbot.wiki.page.Page`,
:py:class:`~earwigbot.wiki.category.Category`, and
:py:class:`~earwigbot.wiki.user.User`) needs.
