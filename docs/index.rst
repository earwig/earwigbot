EarwigBot v0.4 Documentation
============================

EarwigBot_ is a Python bot that edits Wikipedia_ and interacts over IRC_.

History
-------

Development began, based on `Pywikibot`_, in early 2009. Approval for its
first task, a `copyright violation detector`_, was carried out in May, and the
bot has been running consistently ever since. It currently handles
`several ongoing tasks`_ ranging from statistics generation to category
cleanup, and on-demand tasks such as WikiProject template tagging. Since it
started running, the bot has made over 300,000 edits.

The current version of its codebase began development in April 2011, moving
away from Pywikibot to a custom framework.
